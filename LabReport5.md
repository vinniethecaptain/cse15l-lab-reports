# Lab 6 Grading Script #

I didn't have to do much to finish the script since my lab partner and I had done most of it during lab session. The only thing I added was feedback on which methods fail.

When we first started making the script, we had to do many checks before the tester could be run on the student submission's ListExample.java file. We had to make sure the file existed in the first place and after that, we had to make sure the student's file could compile. After that we made sure the method signatures and parameters were exactly the same as the original ListExample template file. After these various checks, we run the tester using two test methods, one to test merge and the other to test the StringChecker using "moon" as a filter. We then gave back the student a percentage score based on how many tests the student passed/failed.
