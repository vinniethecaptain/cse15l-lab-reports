After opening Visual Studio Code, your screen should look like the image above.

## Remote Connect and Git

In order to remotely connect to a UCSD computer, start by downloading Git from https://gitforwindows.org/. Next, go to your VS Code and hit `Ctrl + \(')` or press "New Terminal" in the drop down menu from the "Terminal" button in the top left. Open the command palette using `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type "Select Default Profile" in the command bar. After doing so, select "Git Bash" and then press the "+" icon in the top right of the terminal window. When you're using the bash terminal, type `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` but make sure to replace the zz with the letters in your course-specific account.

Once that is completed, you will need to answer a few questions and enter in your password. With that, your screen should look like this below.

## Running Terminal Commands

Now you're done! Try any of these commands to navigate the file directories of the remote desktop:
- cd 
- ls
- pwd
- cat

To log out of the remote server, hit `Ctrl + D` and run the command exit. Good job!
